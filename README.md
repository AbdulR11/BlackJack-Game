1. Player Initialization: The player starts with a predefined name and zero chips.
2. Card Drawing Mechanism: Cards are drawn randomly, with face cards (Jack, Queen, King) valued at 10, and Aces valued at 11.
3. Game States: The game tracks whether the player is still in the game (isAlive) and whether they have achieved Blackjack (hasBlackJack).
4. Game Controls: Two buttons allow the player to start a new game or draw a new card.
5. Win/Loss Conditions: The game determines if the player wins with a Blackjack, loses by exceeding 21, or continues drawing cards. Players earn or lose chips based on their performance.
6. Confetti Animation: A confetti animation celebrates a Blackjack win using the JSConfetti library.
7. Dynamic Updates: The game dynamically updates the displayed cards, total sum, player chips, and game messages based on the player's actions.

This project provides a fun and interactive way to play a simplified version of Blackjack, demonstrating basic principles of web development and JavaScript programming.
